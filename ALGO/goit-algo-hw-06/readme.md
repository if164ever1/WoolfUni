# Public Transport Network Analysis Using Graph Theory

This project demonstrates the application of graph theory to model and analyze the Kyiv metro system using Python's NetworkX library.


## Project Description

The project consists of three main tasks:

1. **Transport Network Graph Construction** - Creating a model of Kyiv metro with visualization and basic characteristic analysis
2. **DFS and BFS Algorithms Implementation** - Finding paths between stations and comparing results
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Finding shortest paths considering travel time

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries:
  - networkx
  - matplotlib
  - collections

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/if164ever1/goit-algo-hw-06.git
cd goit-algo-hw-06
pip install networkx matplotlib
